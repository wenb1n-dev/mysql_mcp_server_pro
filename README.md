# mcp_mysql_server

## Introduction
mcp_mysql_server_pro is not just about MySQL CRUD operations, but also includes database anomaly analysis capabilities and makes it easy for developers to extend with custom tools.

- Supports both STDIO and SSE modes
- Supports multiple SQL execution, separated by ";"
- Supports querying database table names and fields based on table comments
- Supports SQL execution plan analysis
- Supports Chinese field to pinyin conversion
- Supports table lock analysis
- Supports database health status analysis
- Supports permission control with three roles: readonly, writer, and admin
    ```
    "readonly": ["SELECT", "SHOW", "DESCRIBE", "EXPLAIN"],  # Read-only permissions
    "writer": ["SELECT", "SHOW", "DESCRIBE", "EXPLAIN", "INSERT", "UPDATE", "DELETE"],  # Read-write permissions
    "admin": ["SELECT", "SHOW", "DESCRIBE", "EXPLAIN", "INSERT", "UPDATE", "DELETE", 
             "CREATE", "ALTER", "DROP", "TRUNCATE"]  # Administrator permissions
    ```
- Supports prompt template invocation

## Usage Instructions

### Installation and Configuration
1. Install Package
```bash
pip install mysql-mcp-server-pro
```

2. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file with the following content:
```bash
# MySQL Database Configuration
MYSQL_HOST=localhost
MYSQL_PORT=3306
MYSQL_USER=your_username
MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_password
MYSQL_DATABASE=your_database
# Optional, default is 'readonly'. Available values: readonly, writer, admin
MYSQL_ROLE=readonly
```

3. Run Service
```bash
# SSE mode
mysql-mcp-server

# Or STDIO mode
mysql-mcp-server-stdio
```

Note:
- The `.env` file should be placed in the directory where you run the command
- You can also set these variables directly in your environment
- Make sure the database configuration is correct and can connect


### Local Development with SSE Mode

- Use uv to start the service

Add the following content to your mcp client tools, such as cursor, cline, etc.

mcp json as follows:
```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "operateMysql": {
      "name": "operateMysql",
      "description": "",
      "isActive": true,
      "baseUrl": "http://localhost:9000/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

Modify the .env file content to update the database connection information with your database details:
```
# MySQL Database Configuration
MYSQL_HOST=192.168.xxx.xxx
MYSQL_PORT=3306
MYSQL_USER=root
MYSQL_PASSWORD=root
MYSQL_DATABASE=a_llm
MYSQL_ROLE=readonly  # Optional, default is 'readonly'. Available values: readonly, writer, admin
```

Start commands:
```
# Download dependencies
uv sync

# Start
uv run -m mysql_mcp_server_pro.server 
```

### Local Development with STDIO Mode

Add the following content to your mcp client tools, such as cursor, cline, etc.

mcp json as follows:
```
{
  "mcpServers": {
      "operateMysql": {
        "isActive": true,
        "name": "operateMysql",
        "command": "uv",
        "args": [
          "--directory",
          "G:\\python\\mysql_mcp\\src",  # Replace this with your project path
          "run",
          "server.py",
          "--stdio"
        ],
        "env": {
          "MYSQL_HOST": "192.168.xxx.xxx",
          "MYSQL_PORT": "3306",
          "MYSQL_USER": "root",
          "MYSQL_PASSWORD": "root",
          "MYSQL_DATABASE": "a_llm",
          "MYSQL_ROLE": "readonly"  # Optional, default is 'readonly'. Available values: readonly, writer, admin
       }
    }
  }
}    
```

## Custom Tool Extensions
1. Add a new tool class in the handles package, inherit from BaseHandler, and implement get_tool_description and run_tool methods

2. Import the new tool in __init__.py to make it available in the server

## Examples
1. Create a new table and insert data, prompt format as follows:
```
# Task
   Create an organizational structure table with the following structure: department name, department number, parent department, is valid.
# Requirements
 - Table name: department
 - Common fields need indexes
 - Each field needs comments, table needs comment
 - Generate 5 real data records after creation
```

2. Query data based on table comments, prompt as follows:
```
Search for data with Department name 'Executive Office' in Department organizational structure table
```

3. Analyze slow SQL, prompt as follows:
```
select * from t_jcsjzx_hjkq_cd_xsz_sk xsz
left join t_jcsjzx_hjkq_jcd jcd on jcd.cddm = xsz.cddm 
Based on current index situation, review execution plan and provide optimization suggestions in markdown format, including table index status, execution details, and optimization recommendations
```

4. Analyze SQL deadlock issues, prompt as follows:
```
update t_admin_rms_zzjg set sfyx = '0' where xh = '1' is stuck, please analyze the cause
```

5. Analyze the health status prompt as follows
```
Check the current health status of MySQL
```
